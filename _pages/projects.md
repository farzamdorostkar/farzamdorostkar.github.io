Here is a list of the main projects I have created or contributed to.

## Doxygen

I am happy to have made a small contribution to the [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) project, a widely-used documentation generator tool in software development and hardware design. Doxygen is tailored to automatically generate documentation from source code comments. My proposed changes, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/commits?author=farzamdorostkar), were aimed at refining the tool's documentation to accurately reflect the fundamental difference between Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and programming languages. This effort was essential to underscore this significant distinction, thereby enhancing the precision of the project's documentation. I hope this contribution will also encourage further consideration about how HDLs are perceived and described in technical documentation across the field.
