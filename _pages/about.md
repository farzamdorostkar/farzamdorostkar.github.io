Hi! I am Farzam, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montr√©al. I am a member of [DORSAL](https://www.dorsal.polymtl.ca/en/) lab where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Michel Dagenais](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/dagenais-michel). My current research focus concerns developing low-overhead tools for detecting concurrency and memory bugs using hardware tracing.
