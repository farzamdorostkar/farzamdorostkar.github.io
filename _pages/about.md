Hi! I am Farzam, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montr√©al. I am a member of [DORSAL](https://www.dorsal.polymtl.ca/en/) where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Michel Dagenais](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/dagenais-michel) and the co-supervision of Prof. [Heng Li](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/li-heng) in collaboration with our industry partners including [Ciena](https://www.ciena.com/) and [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en).

My current research focuses on developing low-overhead tools for detecting concurrency bugs and memory access violations in C/C++ programs using a combination of techniques including hardware tracing, compile-time code analysis and transformation, pointer tainting, and runtime analysis.
