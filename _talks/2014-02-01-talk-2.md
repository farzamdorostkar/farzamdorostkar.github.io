This presentation introduces ThreadMonitor (TMon), a low-overhead postmortem data race detector for C/C++ programs. At runtime, it traces the information required for detecting data races (i.e. memory accesses and synchronization events) using Intel Processor Trace (PT), a non-intrusive hardware feature dedicated to tracing software execution. Thereafter, a post-mortem analyzer uses the trace data to emulate the same verification that would be performed by TSan at runtime. TMon has no direct impact on application memory usage and causes a very small slowdown.
